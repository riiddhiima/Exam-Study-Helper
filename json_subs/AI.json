The transition costs (or step costs) are next to the edges, and the heuristic values are indicated within round brackets very close to the states. Apply A* search to expand the nodes systematically by drawing the corresponding tree diagrams. Find the order of expansion of nodes from start state to goal state. (18) (38) (35) (16) Under which condition, Depth first search fails? Explain how Depth limited search (DLS) takes care of this issue of DFS. What is the major drawback of DLS? Finally explain how Iterative deepening search (IDS) solves the issues of DFS and DLS and also combines the benefits of both DFS and Breadth first search (BFS)? Show in a tabular manner the comparative performance measures of six uninformed search strategies, such as, BFS, UCS, DFS, DLS, IDS and BDS. Justify why the time & space complexities of Bidirectional search (BDS) being implemented from both ends using BFS are considerably less than those of Breadth first search (BFS) being implemented only from initial end, for the given initial state and goal state. Find the order of expansion of nodes for the following search graph using i) Uniform cost search (UCS) ii) Greedy best first search Assume start node to be S and goal node to be G. The values indicated along the connecting lines represent step costs or transition costs and values indicated inside the nodes represent heuristic values."
